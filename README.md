# Virtual-Mouse
The virtual mouse uses computer vision and hand-tracking technology to control a computer's cursor without physical contact. By detecting hand movements and gestures through a webcam, users can perform typical mouse functions like clicking, scrolling, and dragging. This innovative project showcases the integration of hardware and software to create a touchless and intuitive user interface.
